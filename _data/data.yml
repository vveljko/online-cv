    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Able to grasp & tackle complex HW/SW mixed systems, foresee potential issues early-on, quickly spot implementation flaws and dive deep into details. My architecture designs are component focused and: high integrity rather than likeable, designed for testing rather than test-driven, robust rather than rich. Versed in mixed HW/SW development process with focus on system specification, automated testing and quality assurance.
